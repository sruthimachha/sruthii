    <p>Solar energy is the energy produced directly by the sun and collected elsewhere, normally the earth. The sun creates its energy through a thermonuclear process. The process creates heat and electromagnetic radiation. Only a small fraction of the total radiation produced reaches the earth. The radiation that does  reaches the earth is the indirect source of nearly every type of energy used today.
The radiation that does reach the earth is the indirect source of nearly every type of energy used today. The exceptions are geothermal energy and nuclear fission and fusion. Even fossil fuel owe their origins to the sun they were once living plants and animals whose life was dependent upon the sun.
Much of the world’s required energy can be supplied directly by solar power. More still can be provided indirectly. The practicality of doing so will be examined, as well as the benefits and drawbacks. In addition, the uses solar energy is currently applied to will be noticed.
Due to the nature of solar energy, two components are required to have a functional solar energy generator. These two components are a collector and a storage unit. The collector simply collects the radiation that falls on it and converts a fraction of it to other forms of energy(either electricity and heat or heat alone). The storage unit is required because of the non-constant nature of solar energy at certain times only a very small amount of radiation will be received. At night or during heavy cloud cover, for example, the amount of energy produced by the collector will be quite small. The storage unit can hold the excess energy produced during the periods of maximum productivity, and release it when the productivity drops. In practice, a backup power supply is usually added, too for the situations when the amount of energy required is greater than both what is being produced and what is stored in the container.
The term "photovoltaic" comes from the Greek (photo) means "light", and "voltaic", means electric ,from the name of the Italian physicist “VOLTA "after whom a unit of electro-motive force, the volt is named.  The sun is a star made up of hydrogen and helium gas and it radiates an enormous amount of energy every second.
A photovoltaic cell is an electrical device that convert the energy of light directly into electricity by photovoltaic effect. 
Photovoltaic is the cell.</p></div>

<p>Due to the increased demand for renewable energy sources, the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years.
Solar photovoltaic is now, after hydro and wind power, the third most important renewable energy source in terms of globally installed capacity. More than 100 countries use solar PV. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building (either or simply rooftop).
Driven by advances in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication, the cost of photovoltaic has declined steadily since the first solar cells were manufactured, and the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) from PV is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regionsThe principle used to generate electricity from the solar
panels is the same as that used to generate electricity from
the chemical reaction using a standard battery. The basic
working of solar panels depends on the semi conductor
property of silicon. The silicon is a unique substance that
has revolutionized the way electronic appliances work. This
property is used to generate electricity from the solar
panels. In order to understand how solar panels work we
need to understand how silicon works at an atomic level.
Silicon in its pure form i.e. when all the impurities have
been removed a silicon atom is bonded with another silicon
atom. Since the valency of silicon atom is 8 which means
that there are 8 electrons in its outermost orbit.</p></div>

<p>The current market leader in efficient solar energy modules is sun power, whose solar panels have a conversion ratio of 19.3%, with sanyo having the most efficient modules at 20.4%. However, a whole range of other companies (Holosun, Gamma solar, Nanohorizons) are emerging which are also offering new innovations in photovoltaic modules, with a conversion ratio of around 18%. These new innovations include power generation on the front and back sides and increased outputs, however most of these companies have not yet produced working systems from their design plans and are mostly still actively improving the technology.Though the years, technology has allowed the cellular
    phone to shrink not only the size of the ICs, but also the
    batteries. However, as technology has advanced and made
    our phone smaller and easier to use we still have one of the
    original problem that we must plug the phones into the
    walls in order to recharge the battery. Most people accept
    the reality as there is no other option to this problem so they
    carry extra batteries with them. Every time it is not possible
    to charge mobile batteries everywhere at any time so we
    design this mobile charger from which we can charge the
    mobile battery anywhere at any time. In this project we are
    using the concept of energy harvesting by using solar
    energy for battery charging purpose. By using this we can
    charge our mobile battery in remote areas where there is a
    problem of electricity. Cost of this circuitry can be reduced
    to certain extend so that common man can easily purchase
    that and get benefit from that.</p></div>

  <p>A solar cell is a device that converts the energy of sunlight directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect. Sometimes the term solar cell is reserved for devices intended specifically to capture energy from sunlight such as solar panels and solar cells, while the term photovoltaic cell is used when the light source is unspecified. Assemblies of cells are used to make solar panels, solar modules, and photovoltaic arrays. Photovoltaic is the field of technology and research related to the application of solar cells in provided to charge the mobile by house hold general purpose 230V in the absence of the sun light. The solar panel can be used as a component of a larger photovoltaic system to generate and supply electricity in commercial and residential applications. Each module is read by its dc output power under standard test conditions (STC), and typically ranges from 100 to 320 watts.The principle used to generate electricity from the solar
    panels is the same as that used to generate electricity from
    the chemical reaction using a standard battery. The basic
    working of solar panels depends on the semi conductor
    property of silicon. The silicon is a unique substance that
    has revolutionized the way electronic appliances work. This

    been removed a silicon atom is bonded with another silicon
    atom. Since the valency of silicon atom is 8 which means
    that there are 8 electrons in its outermost orbit. However in
    its natural state there are only 4 electrons bounded in the
    outermost orbit. </p></div>

   <p>However, it was not until 1883 that the first solar cell was built, by Charles frits, who coated the semiconductor selenium with an extremely thin layer of gold to form the junctions. The device was only around 1% efficient. Subsequently Russian physicist Aleksandra stoletov built the first solar cell based on the outer photoelectric effect (discovered by heinrich hertz earlier in 1887). Albert Einstein explained the photoelectric effect in 1905 for which he received the Nobel the first solar cell based on the outer photoelectric effect (discovered by heinrich hertz earlier in 1887). Albert Einstein explained the photoelectric effect in 1905 for which he received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921We have to switch to clean an energy source, which is for
    sure after realizing the consequences of using the fossil
    fuels and destroying the environment. The big question is
    how? Millions around the world depend on the vast energy
    reserves available deep down the earth. The reserves are
    depleting and will dry out soon. On the other hand the
    demand and the consumption rate are not going down. This
    is why we have to find out an energy source which will not
    only be free of pollution and eco friendly but also be able to
    produce enough energy to power our needs? So the question
    is whether there exist and energy source that can meet our
    needs or not. Let us discuss three alternative energy
    solutions that are available and find out whether that can be
    the one or not. These changes in the temperature and
    pressure occur due to the difference in the amounts of heat
    energy received by different areas from the sun depending
    on the earth’s rotation. </p></div>
